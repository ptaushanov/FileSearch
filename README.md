## 📝 Task description 📝

Write a program that searches for a word in a list of files (store the ID for
each file, string with the path to the file, file size in bytes). When there is
more than one file specified by the command line, search in all files. The
results are an array containing the names of the files (with the search word)
and on which line it was found (there can be more than one). Write them down.
Allow the user to filter the output, ie search only in the largest or smallest
file.
